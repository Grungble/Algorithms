I'll beat thee, but I would infect my hands
The tartness of your face sours ripe grapes
Away, you starvelling, you elf-skin, you dried neat's-tongue, bull's-pizzle, you stock-fish!
I am sick when I do look on thee
I must tell you friendly in your ear, sell when you can, you are not for all markets
Methink'st thou art a general offence and every man should beat thee
More of your conversation would infect my brainThe rankest compound of villainous smell that ever offended nostril
Thine face is not worth sunburning
Thou art a boil, a plague sore
Like the toad; ugly and venomous
Thou art unfit for any place but hell
Thou cream faced loon
Thou damned and luxurious mountain goat
Thou lump of foul deformity
Thou sodden-witted lord! Thou hast no more brain than I have in mine elbows
Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon
Your brain is as dry as the remainder biscuit after voyage
Out of my sight! Thou dost infect mine eyes
You have such a February face, So full of frost, of storm, and cloudiness
